# This is a calendar to list and track the tasks I would like to accomplish. 

At the start, I will implement a strike through mmanually if I completed a task and later I will introduce javascript to have symbols for tasks' completetion status. A database will be added (when learnt) to rememeber the status of a task in lieu of a strike-through.

TODO {
 1: Look up using an header1 tag for an image header so you have an image of your project as the header at a later date.
