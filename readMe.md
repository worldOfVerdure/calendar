At the start, I will implement a strike through mmanually if I completed a task and later I will introduce javascript to have symbols for tasks' completetion status. A database will be added (when learnt) to rememeber the status of a task in lieu of a strike-through.

Goals:
- [X] Center rune
- [ ] Make actual calender section
- [ ] Make new svg that scales entire viewport in header (gold bar ;)
